Soma-workflow concepts

Job
===

A job is mainly defined by a command (blue boxes on the figure). 


Workflow
========

A workflow is a set of jobs (blue boxes on the figure) with execution dependencies between jobs (arrows on the figure). 

A dependency from a job A to a job B means that the job A won't start before the
job B is done. 

.. figure:: images/workflow_example_reduced.*

The workflows and jobs are Python objects of class soma.workflow.client.Workflow
can be submitted to a computing resource using the GUI or the Python API. 
The users can build their own workflows and run them on the resources of their 
choice using soma-workflow. Eventually, the objective is also to generate 
workflows from pipeline softwares. The automatic workflow generation is already
available for some `BrainVISA <http://brainvisa.info/>`_  pipelines. 

Once submitted, each job will start as soon as possible depending on its 
dependencies.
