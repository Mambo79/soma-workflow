Soma-workflow concepts
======================


Job
===

A job is mainly defined by a program command line. It doesn't necessarly need 
several CPU to be executed.

A parallel job is a job made to run on several CPU. The program uses parallel
code such as MPI, OpenMP.. 


Workflow
========

A workflow organizes the execution of a set of jobs defining execution 
dependencies between jobs.

A dependency from a job A to a job B means that the job A won't start before 
the job B is done.

Figure: workflow example. The jobs are reprensented by blue boxes and the 
dependencies by black arrows.

Once the workflow is created (see :ref:`workflow-creation-api`), and submitted 
to a computing resource using the API or the GUI, soma-workflow handles the 
execution of the jobs. Each job starts as soon as possible considering its dependencies.
