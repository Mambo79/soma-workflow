Job, Worklfows and File Transfers
=================================

**Job**

  A job is mainly defined by a program command line. It does not necessarily 
  need several CPU to be executed. A jobs has also a standard input, output and 
  error, a working directory and can be associated to file transfers if needed 
  (see further in this section).

  A parallel job is a job made to run on several CPUs. The job program uses 
  parallel code such as MPI, OpenMP... 

 
**Workflow**

  A workflow organizes the execution of a set of jobs defining execution 
  dependencies between jobs.

  A dependency from a job A to a job B means that the job A will not start before 
  the job B is done. 

  .. figure:: images/workflow_example.*
    :scale: 50 

    Workflow example. The jobs are represented by blue boxes and the 
    dependencies by black arrows.

  Once the workflow is created, and submitted to a computing resource using the 
  API or the GUI (see :ref::ref:`examples` and :ref:`workflow-creation-api`), 
  soma-workflow handles the execution of the jobs on the computing resource. 
  Each job starts as soon as possible considering its dependencies.

.. _file-transfers-concept:

**File Transfer**
  
  The file transfers are only required when the user's file system is not 
  shared with the computing resource.

  A file transfer object is a mapping between a file path valid on the user file 
  system and a file path valid on the computing resource file system.

  Soma-workflow handles transfers of the files or directories to and from the 
  computing resource file system. The file transfer objects are associated to 
  jobs (as input or output) in workflows. That way a job will never be executed 
  before all its input files are transfered on the computing resource.

.. _shared-resource-path-concept:

**Shared Resource Path**

  As file transfers, shared resource paths are only required when the user's
  file system is not shared by the computing resource.
  A shared resource path is a path representation that is valid on either 
  user's or computing resource file system. 


DRMS, Client, Workflow Engine and Database Server
=================================================

.. image:: images/architecture_overview.* 
  :scale: 50 

**TO DO**
  
..
  The soma-workflow architecture allows the client to access remote computing 
  resource and to disconnect at any time. The WorkflowEngine process, which runs 
  on the computing resource side, is in charge of submitting the workflow jobs
  to the DRMS at the right time. 


Status
======


Job status
----------

Here is the list of the job status.

  |no_status| **not_submitted**
    The job was not submitted yet to soma-workflow.

  |undeter| **undetermined**
    Transitive status. The job status is changing and be updated soon

  |pending| **submission_pending**
    Due to a limitation of the number of job in the queue (see :ref:`conf_server_option`), the job is 
    waiting to be submitted to the DRMS.
  
  |queued| **queued_active**
    The job was submitted to the DRMS and is currently waiting in the queue.
  
  |running| **running**
    The job is running on the computing resource.

  |success| or |failed| **done**
    The job finished normally. However it does not mean that it ended with 
    success (see :ref:`job-exit-status`)

  |failed| **failed**
    The job exited abnormally before finishing.

  |warning| **warning**
    The worklfow engine process in charge of the monitoring of the job status
    was killed or failed. The job or the workflow containing the job has to be 
    restarted.

  |kd_pending| **delete_pending**    
    Transitive status. The job will be deleted soon.

  |kd_pending| **kill_pending**       
    Transitive status. The job will be killed soon.

  system_suspended

.. _job-exit-status:

Job exit status
--------------- 

  **finished_regularly**
    The job finished regularly. The exit value is displayed on the GUI and is available from the Python API. If the value is different from 0 soma-workflow considers that the job failed.

  **finished_signal**
    The job finished due to a signal. The signal is displayed on the GUI and is available from the python API (depending on DRMAA implementation).

  **killed_by_user**
     The job was killed by the user.

  **aborted**
    The job never ran.

  **exit_status_undetermined**
    The exit status can not be determined.

..
  **finished_unclear_condition**
    The job finished with unclear conditions.




Workflow status
---------------

  **worklflow_not_started**
    The workflow was not submitted to soma-workflow.
  
  **workflow_in_progress**
    The workflow was submitted to soma-workflow.

  **workflow_done**
    The workflow is done.

  **delete_pending**
    Transitive status. The workflow will be deleted soon.

  **warning**
    The workflow engine process in charge of the workflow execution was killed 
    or failed on the computing resource side. The workflow has to be restarted
    (the jobs which ended with success will not be restarted).


.. note::
  |warning| In case of warning status a simple solution is to restart the 
  workflow. 
  The job which ended with success will not be restarted.

  However, the warning status does not mean that the jobs failed. In case of very 
  long jobs which you do not want to restart, you can check yourself
  the status of the job(s) on the DRMS. If some jobs are still running: you 
  have to wait for the job to finish. Afterward, update the status of each job 
  in soma-workflow and restart the jobs.



File Transfer status
--------------------

  |tr_do_not_exist| **do not exist**
    The file(s) do not exist. For example: output files at the beginning of a
    workflow execution.

  |tr_on_c| **on client side**
    The file(s) exist on the client side only. For example: input files.

  |tr_on_cr| **on computing resource side**
    The file(s) exist on the computing resource side only. For example: output
    files after a job ended.

  |tr_on_both| **on both sides**
    The file(s) both on the client and computing resource side. This status 
    appears after a transfer ended. 

  |tr_c_to_cr| **transfering client->cr**
    The file(s) are being transfered form the client to the computing resource.

  |tr_cr_to_c| **transfering cr->client**
    The file(s) are being transfered from the computing resource to the client.

  |under_edition| **under edition**
    The file(s) are under edition, they are output and/or input of a running 
    job.
