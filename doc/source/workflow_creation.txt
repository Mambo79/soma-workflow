Workflow creation API
=====================

The workflows are created using the soma.workflow.client API. This page is the 
documentation of the workflow, job and file transfer objects, 

.. note::
  Eventually, the objective of this API is also to generate workflows from
  pipeline softwares. The automatic workflow generation is already available for 
  some `BrainVISA <http://brainvisa.info/>`_  pipelines. 

.. seealso:: :ref:`examples` for a quick start.
