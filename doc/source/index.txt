Welcome to soma-workflow documentation!
=======================================

Soma-workflow objective is to provide a homogeneous and single way to submit 
and monitor parallel computing to any computing resource (laptops, 
workstation farms, clusters...). 

The submission, control and monitoring is done via a simple Python application 
programming interface (API) or a graphical user interface (GUI). 

Soma-workflow uses existing distributed resource management systems (such as 
Grid Engine, Condor, Torque/PBS, LSF..) installed on the computing resources to 
execute the jobs. 

Soma-workflow is an open source Python application.
The sources can be found `here. <https://brainvisa:Soma2009@bioproj.extra.cea.fr/redmine/projects/brainvisa-soma/repository/show/soma-workflow/trunk>`_ 

**The documentation is under construction.**
