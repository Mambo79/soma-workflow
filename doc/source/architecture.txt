Architecture overview
=====================
..
  The soma-workflow architecture allows the client to access remote computing 
  resource and to disconnect at any time. The WorkflowEngine process, which runs 
  on the computing resource side, is in charge of submitting the workflow's jobs
  to the DRMS at the right time.

  Soma-workflow uses DRMAA to interface the distributed resource management 
  systems. It was tested with Condor, Sun Grid Engine, Torque/PBS and LSF.
  It uses ssh via the Paramiko module.
