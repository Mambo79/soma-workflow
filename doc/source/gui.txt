========================
Graphical User Interface 
========================


Connection
==========

When the GUI is started, you can connect to one of the configured 
computing resources (see :ref:`client_configuration`) through a dialog window. 
Without special configuration, you can always choose the current machine you are 
using, the number of CPU will be detected and you will be able to control at 
any time the number of CPU used.

A login and password are only requested if the connection is remote. To avoid 
to fill them, the login can be registered in the configuration file, and a
RSA key can be used. 

Main Window
===========

When at least one resource is activated. The main application window is the 
following: 

.. image:: images/soma_workflow_gui.*
   :scale: 70


1. Computing resources
----------------------

This widget displays the list of active computing resource (two in the example) 
and gives at any time their current status (if some workflows are running or 
not). Connection to other computing resources is achieved with the "Add" button
which open the connection dialog window.

.. image:: images/gui_resource_list.*
   :scale: 80

Some special controls may appear for some computing resources. In the example, 
the computing resource named "is206464" is the local computer: 2 CPUs were 
detected, however you can change the number of used CPUs 
at any time. The other computing resource is a remote cluster where a limitation 
of the number of job in the queues was configured. When such a configuration 
exist, the limits are displayed here and can be adjusted at any time. 

2. Workflow selection
---------------------

When a computing resource is selected, this widget display the list of the 
workflow previously submitted to the computing resource. These workflows can 
either be done or still running. At any time, a blue icon with an white "r" 
signals the running workflows. The ended workflows stay in the list until they 
are deleted or their expiration date is reached. The expiration date can be 
changed in the "Workflow" menu.

3. Workflow global information
------------------------------

This widget displays the main information about the selected workflow. 

.. image:: images/gui_workflow_info.*
   :scale: 80

The workflow status is updated at regular time interval (3 seconds). 
If you are using a cluster, the workflow queue can be changed stopping and 
restarting the workflow. 
You can change the workflow expiration date in the "Workflow" menu. However, 
the running workflows are never deleted. 


4. Workflow view
----------------

The selected workflow is displayed as a tree in the central window. At any time, 
the icons show the state of the workflow elements (see :ref:`status_list`). Gray 
icons mean that the workflow was not submitted yet. 

The groups can be extended to be explored. Their icons are little disks.

* A blue disk: at least on job in running inside the group. 
* A red disk: at least on job failed inside the group.
* A green disk: all the jobs finished with success inside the group.

.. image:: images/gui_workflow_view.*
   :scale: 80

In the example, the groups displayed contains all running jobs except the group 
named "103. Morphologist 2011", where a job failed. The groups named "104. 
Morphologist 2011" and "107. Morphologist 2011" were extended to display the 
jobs inside. Among the displayed jobs, some ended, one is running, one is in 
the submission queue, and some are waiting to be submitted (no icon).


5. Job filter
-------------

The widget under the tree can be used to filter the displayed jobs. Enter text
and/or select job status: the tree will be automatically updated.

6. Selection information
------------------------

This widget display the information about the selected item in the tree. 

Here is what is displayed when a job is selected:

.. image:: images/gui_job_info_1.*
   :scale: 80

.. image:: images/gui_job_info_2.*
   :scale: 80

.. image:: images/gui_job_info_3.*
   :scale: 80



7. Workflow control
-------------------

In the menu, select "File/Open" to load a workflow saved into a file. 
Then press the "submit" button to submit the workflow.

If a workflow was submitted outside of the GUI (using the python API for 
example) use the "refresh" button to load it into the GUI.

The running workflows can be stopped at any time. This action remove the jobs 
from the submission queue and kills the running jobs which statuses toggle from 
running to failed.

When an ended workflow has some failed jobs, it can be restarted. The failed 
jobs will be submitted again to the computing resource. Note that the submission
queue can be changed at that time. 


8. Plots
--------

Several plots can be displayed and refreshed at regular time interval:

* the jobs function of the time.
* the number of jobs running function of the time.
